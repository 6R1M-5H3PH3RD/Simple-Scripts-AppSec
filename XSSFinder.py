#To create an advanced XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) detector using Python, you can use a combination of regular expressions and HTML parsing to search for potential XSS vulnerabilities in a given website.
#Here is a high-level overview of the steps you can follow to create an advanced XSS detector:
#1. Import the necessary modules: To start, you will need to import the requests module to make HTTP requests to the website, and the re and html modules to work with regular expressions and parse HTML.
#2. Define a function to make an HTTP request to the website: This function should take in a URL and make an HTTP GET request to the website. It should return the HTML content of the website as a string.
#3. Define a function to parse the HTML content: This function should take in the HTML content of the website as a string and parse it using the html module. It should return a list of HTML elements that contain user-inputted data.
#4. Define a function to search for XSS vulnerabilities: This function should take in the list of HTML elements that contain user-inputted data and search for potential XSS vulnerabilities using a combination of regular expressions and HTML parsing. It should return a list of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
#5. Define the main function and put everything together: In the main function, you can prompt the user for the website URL and then call the other functions to make an HTTP request to the website, parse the HTML content, and search for XSS vulnerabilities. You can then print the list of potential XSS vulnerabilities to the console.
#6. Here is some sample code that illustrates how you can implement these steps:

#This is the complete program that searches for potential XSS vulnerabilities in a given website using a combination of regular expressions and HTML parsing. It prompts the user for the website URL, makes an HTTP request to the website, parses the HTML content, and searches for XSS vulnerabilities. 
# It then prints the list of potential XSS vulnerabilities to the console.
# If you want HTML table from the data/findings then uncomment the bottom code which will generate an HTML table from the data and store it in the html_table variable

import requests
import re
import html

def make_request(url):
    # Make an HTTP GET request to the website
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # Return the HTML content of the website
    return response.text

def parse_html(html_content):
    # Parse the HTML content
    root = html.fromstring(html_content)
    
    # Find all HTML elements that contain user-inputted data
    input_elements = root.xpath("//input | //textarea")
    
    # Return the list of input elements
    return input_elements

def search_for_xss(input_elements):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    xss_vulnerabilities = []
    
    # Define a regular expression to search for potential XSS vulnerabilities
    xss_regex = r"<[^>]*script[^>]*>"
    
    # Iterate through the input elements
    for element in input_elements:
        # Check if the element contains a potential XSS vulnerability
        if re.search(xss_regex, element.text_content(), re.IGNORECASE):
            xss_vulnerabilities.append(element.get("name"))
    
    # Return the list of potential XSS vulnerabilities
    return xss_vulnerabilities

def main():
    # Prompt the user for the website URL
    url = input("Enter the website URL: ")
    
    # Make an HTTP request to the website
    html_content = make_request(url)
    
    # Parse the HTML content
    input_elements = parse_html(html_content)
    
    # Search for XSS vulnerabilities
	xss_vulnerabilities = search_for_xss(input_elements)
	
	# Print the list of potential XSS vulnerabilities
print("Potential XSS vulnerabilities:", xss_vulnerabilities)


#Finally, we will call the main function to start the program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


#Here is a function that takes in a list of results and generates an HTML table from the data, including the severity and confidence of the findings. This function can be used to store the results of the Python program that searches for hardcoded credentials, PII, IP addresses, and URLs in source code files and log files with no extension in a given directory and its subdirectories, removes duplicates, and provides the severity and confidence of each result:
#
#def generate_html_table(results):
#    # Create the HTML table
#    html_table = "<table>\n"
#    html_table += "<tr>\n"
#    html_table += "<th>Type</th>\n"
#    html_table += "<th>Severity</th>\n"
#    html_table += "<th>Confidence</th>\n"
#    html_table += "<th>Value</th>\n"
#    html_table += "<th>File</th>\n"
#    html_table += "</tr>\n"
#    
#    # Add the results to the table
#    for result in results:
#        html_table += "<tr>\n"
#        html_table += "<td>{}</td>\n".format(html.escape(result["type"]))
#        html_table += "<td>{}</td>\n".format(html.escape(result["severity"]))
#        html_table += "<td>{}</td>\n".format(html.escape(result["confidence"]))
#        html_table += "<td>{}</td>\n".format(html.escape(result["value"]))
#        html_table += "<td>{}</td>\n".format(html.escape(result["file"]))
#        html_table += "</tr>\n"
#    
#    # Close the table
#    html_table += "</table>\n"
#    
#    # Return the HTML table
#    return html_table
#
#To use this function, you can simply call it and pass in the list of results as an argument. For example:
#html_table = generate_html_table(results)
#This will generate an HTML table from the data and store it in the html_table variable. You can then use this variable to display the HTML table in a web browser or save it to a file.
