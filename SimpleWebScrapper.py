# This code creates a queue of URLs to scrape and a thread pool with 4 threads. 
# Each thread takes a URL from the queue, scrapes the page, and saves the data. 
# Using multithreading allows you to scrape multiple pages simultaneously, which can significantly speed up your scraper.
# Keep in mind that you should always respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file when web scraping, and be gentle by not sending too many requests too quickly. 
# You should also consider using a cache to store the results of your requests and a rotating proxy service to avoid getting blocked.
