#This script uses the requests library to send a request to a given URL and check the response status code. If the status code is 200 (which indicates a successful request), then the access control check is considered to have passed. If the status code is anything other than 200, then the access control check is considered to have failed.
#You can modify this script to suit your specific needs. For example, you could add additional checks to verify that the response headers or body contain the expected values, or you could add logic to handle different types of HTTP status codes.
