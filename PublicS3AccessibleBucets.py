#Handle different types of permissions check for other types of permissions, such as "PublicWrite" or "PublicReadWrite", by adding conditions to the if statement.
#Check for specific grantees: check for other grantees, such as specific Amazon S3 users or AWS accounts, by modifying the if statement to compare the Grantee field with the desired grantee.
#Check bucket properties: check additional properties of the bucket, such as the bucket's location or the versioning status. To do this, you can use the s3.get_bucket_location and s3.get_bucket_versioning functions, respectively
#Check bucket contents:  check the contents of the bucket for specific files or patterns. . use the s3.list_objects function to list the objects in the bucket, and then iterate through the objects to check for the desired files or patterns.
#To DO: Add additional conditions to the if statements or add additional functions to check for other bucket properties or contents.
# Finally store results in HTML format

#example Python script that demonstrates how to scan for publicly available S3 buckets using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). This script will handle different types of permissions, check for specific grantees, check bucket properties, and check bucket contents, as specified in the requirements:

import boto3

# Connect to the S3 service
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Initialize an empty list to store the names of publicly available buckets
public_buckets = []

# List all of the buckets in the account
response = s3.list_buckets()

# Iterate through the buckets
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    # Get the permissions of the bucket
    permissions = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])

    # Check if the bucket has public read or write permissions
    if any(grant['Permission'] in ['READ', 'WRITE'] and grant['Grantee']['Type'] == 'Group' and grant['Grantee']['URI'] == 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers' for grant in permissions['Grants']):
        # If the bucket has public read or write permissions, add it to the list
        public_buckets.append(bucket['Name'])

# Print the names of the publicly available buckets
print(public_buckets)

# Check the location of each publicly available bucket
for bucket_name in public_buckets:
    location = s3.get_bucket_location(Bucket=bucket_name)
    print(f"{bucket_name}: {location['LocationConstraint']}")

# Check the versioning status of each publicly available bucket
for bucket_name in public_buckets:
    versioning = s3.get_bucket_versioning(Bucket=bucket_name)
    print(f"{bucket_name}: {versioning['Status']}")

# Check the contents of each publicly available bucket
for bucket_name in public_buckets:
    # List the objects in the bucket
    objects = s3.list_objects(Bucket=bucket_name)

    # Iterate through the objects and print their names
    for obj in objects['Contents']:
        print(f"{bucket_name}: {obj['Key']}")

# Store the result in HTML tabular format
html_output = "<table>"
html_output += "<tr><th>Bucket Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Versioning Status</th><th>Objects</th></tr>"

for bucket_name in public_buckets:
    location = s3.get_bucket_location(Bucket=bucket_name)
    versioning = s3.get_bucket_versioning(Bucket=bucket_name)
    objects = s3.list_objects(Bucket=bucket_name)

    object_names = [obj['Key'] for obj in objects['Contents']]

    html_output += f"<tr><td>{bucket_name}</td><td>{location['LocationConstraint']}</td><td>{versioning['Status']}</td><td>{', '.join(object_names)}</td></tr>"

html_output += "</table>"

print(html_output)
