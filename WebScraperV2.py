#Write efficient web scraper in python using below requirements:
#Use a fast HTTP library: Use a library like requests or aiohttp to make HTTP requests, as they are faster and more efficient than using the built-in urllib library.
#Use a headless browser: A headless browser is a browser that can be controlled programmatically but does not have a user interface. Using a headless browser allows you to scrape websites that rely on JavaScript to load content, but it is slower than making HTTP requests directly. Popular headless browsers include PhantomJS, Selenium, and Puppeteer.
#Use a cache: If you are scraping a large website or scraping the same website multiple times, it can be helpful to use a cache to store the results of your requests. This can save time and reduce the load on the website's servers.
#Use multithreading or asynchronous programming: If you are scraping multiple pages simultaneously, you can use multithreading or asynchronous programming to speed up your scraper. This allows you to make multiple requests at the same time, rather than waiting for each request to complete before making the next one.
#Respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file: Make sure to read the website's terms of service and adhere to any restrictions they may have on web scraping. Additionally, check the website's robots.txt file for any instructions on how bots should behave on the site.
#use Automatic rotating proxy service: If you are scraping a large number of pages from the same website, the website's server may block your IP address. Using a rotating proxy service can help you avoid getting blocked by rotating your IP address for each request.
#Be gentle: Make sure to not send too many requests too quickly, as this can put a strain on the website's servers and may result in your IP being blocked. Consider adding delays between requests or using a task queue to spread the load out over time.

# Use Automatic rotating proxy service:
#To use an automatic rotating proxy service, you will need to make an HTTP request to the proxy service's API to retrieve a new proxy for each request you make. You can then use this proxy by setting the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables before making the request. Here is an example of how this could be done using the requests library:

def get_proxy():
  proxy_url = "http://proxy_service_url"
  response = requests.get(proxy_url)
  if response.status_code == 200:
    proxy = response.text
    return proxy
  return None

def scrape_with_proxy(url):
  # Get new proxy for each request
  proxy = get_proxy()
  if proxy:
    # Set environment variables for HTTP and HTTPS proxy
    os.environ["http_proxy"] = proxy
    os.environ["https_proxy"] = proxy

    # Make request using proxy
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
      return response.text
  return None
  
#To be gentle and avoid sending too many requests too quickly, you can add a delay between requests or use a task queue to spread the load out over time. To add a delay, you can use the time module's sleep function to pause the script for a certain number of seconds before making the next request. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:

import time

def scrape_with_delay(urls):
  for url in urls:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
      # Do something with the response

    # Add delay between requests
    time.sleep(1)  # Delay for 1 second

#Alternatively, you can use a task queue to spread the load out over time. There are several libraries available for implementing task queues in Python, such as Celery and RQ. You can enqueue tasks to be executed by worker processes at a later time, allowing you to spread out the load and avoid making too many requests too quickly.
