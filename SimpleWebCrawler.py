# example of an efficient web crawler in Python using the requests library, multithreading, and a breadth-first search algorithm.
#This code creates a queue of URLs to crawl and a thread pool with 4 threads. 
#Each thread takes a URL from the queue, crawls the page, extracts the links, and adds them to the queue.
#EUsing multithreading allows you to crawl multiple pages simultaneously, which can significantly speed up your crawler.
#The breadth-first search algorithm ensures that the crawler visits the pages in the order they are discovered, rather than going deep into one part of the website before visiting other parts.
#Keep in mind that you should always respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file when web crawling, and be gentle by not sending too many requests too quickly. 
#You should also consider using a cache to store the results of your requests and a rotating proxy service to avoid getting blocked.
